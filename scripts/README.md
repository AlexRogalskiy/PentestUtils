# Pentest Utils Scripts   
This folder contains some useful scripts for Pentesting     

### batch_cmd_url.sh   
Open tmux terminals and execute a command on multiple urls ( by default, dirb ):  
``` 
 ./batch_cmd_url.sh -f urls.txt   
 ```        
 
 You can change the command by using -c option:   
 ``` 
./batch_cmd_url.sh -f urls.txt -c "gobuster -w raft-medium-files.txt -u \$\$" 
 ```         
 
 *NOTE*: use `\$\$` as placeholder.  
 You can use  `&&` placeholder in command to replace filename:  
 ```  
 dirb \$\$ -r -o &&  
 ``` 
 
 Options:   
 ``` 
-f input file                                                                                                                      
-k: kill tmux session
